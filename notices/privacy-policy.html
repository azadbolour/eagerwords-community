  <h4>EagerWords Privacy Policy</h4>
</div>

<p>
  <b>Effective date: Feb 1, 2023</b>
</p>

<h4>The Basics</h4>

<p>
You use EagerWords in two modalities: as an anonymous guest, or as a registered user.
The EagerWords IOS/iPhone app allows you to play only as an anonymous guest.
The EagerWords browser application allows you to play as a guest or as a
registered user.
</p>

<p>
The games you play are stored in the EagerWords database. But guest games are 
are stored anonymously.
</p>

<p>
EagerWords does not collect any information from guest users.
</p>

<p>
  When you register with EagerWords, you provide us with your email address and your
  nickname ("Personally Identifying Information", PII). Your email address is used to
  uniquely identify you to the site. EagerWords uses passwordless authentication.
  To login to EagerWords, you supply your email address, EagerWords sends a login
  token to your email address, and you use that token to login to EagerWords. Your
  nickname is used to personalize some of the data presented to you on the site,
  and to identify you to other registered users so that you may connect to play
  a game with each other. Your email address and your nickname are the only
  PII we collect about you.
</p>
<p>
  If you are a registered user, EagerWords keeps track of your game and other
  preferences, and the games you have played ("User-Specific Information", USI).
</p>
<p>
  The PII and USI as described above constitute the only information we collect
  that is associated with specific users. Your PII and USI are available to you
  only (by logging in), and not to any other user or entity.
</p>
<p>
  EagerWords does not share your PII or USI with any third party. Nor does it
  obtain information about you from third parties.
</p>
<p>
  Please note that anyone having access to your email account can use
  EagerWords as yourself to access and modify your information. Such
  modification includes unregistering from the site,
  thereby causing all your PII and USI to be permanently deleted.
</p>
<p>
  For internal use, EagerWords may collect other information not related to
  specific users that will help it improve its services ("Non-Specific
  Information", NSI).
</p>
<p>
  EagerWords may use cookies to monitor, manage, enhance and improve its Services.
  You may choose to block cookies in your browser. Blocking cookies may prevent
  you from using the full range of our services.
</p>
<p>
  Note that we may be obliged to communicate with you by your email when required by
  law, or if there is important information you need to know about EagerWords
  that cannot otherwise be provided to you in a timely fashion.
</p>

<h4>Removing Your Information</h4>

<p>
  You may unregister from EagerWords at any time. Unregistering will remove all of
  your information from the active EagerWords site.
</p>
<p>
  However, internally data may still remain in backups, and/or be retained
  for legal reasons and to satisfy any of the authorized uses under
  our Terms of Use. For example, EagerWords may use retained data to
  prevent, investigate, or identify possible wrongdoings in connection with the
  Services or to comply with legal obligations.
</p>
<p>
  In rare circumstances, EagerWords may be forced to recover its database from
  backups. Such recovery can, in principle, also restore your registration and
  user information. Please make sure you have remained unregistered 30 days after
  unregistration. In the rare event that EagerWords was forced to do a backup
  restoration that also restored your registration, please unregister again.
</p>

<h4>Updates</h4>

<p>
  An update to the EagerWords site may include an update to this Privacy Policy.
  The EagerWords landing page includes the date of the last update to the site.
  A change in that date is an indication for you to review this Privacy
  Policy again. You may unregister from EagerWords should an update to the Privacy
  Policy no longer meet your privacy needs.
</p>

<h4>Security of Your Information</h4>

<p>
  EagerWords takes measures designed to protect your information from accidental
  or unlawful destruction, accidental loss or unauthorized access, use,
  modification, interference, or disclosure.
</p>
<p>
  Please be aware, however, that no method of transmitting information over the
  internet or storing information is completely secure. Accordingly, EagerWords
  cannot guarantee the absolute security of any information. EagerWords is not
  liable for unintentional data breaches, malware, or hacking in your use of the
  Services. If you feel that your accountâ€™s security is compromised, please
  contact us immediately.
</p>

<h4>Correspondence</h4>

<p>
  If you choose to correspond with us through our Services or via email, we may
  retain the content of your email together with your email address, other
  included information, and our responses.
